sclang / sclang++ emulate clang / clang++ except that they also invoke
Souper.

To avoid the need to mess with build systems, communication with these
programs is via environment variables. Unless noted, the value of the
environment variable is irrelevant: sclang only checks if it is set.

SOUPER_DEBUG -- Print debugging info.

SOUPER_DYNAMIC_PROFILE -- Instrument the compiled program such that,
when run, it will communicate with a running Redis instance in order
to report how many times each optimized code site executes.

SOUPER_DYNAMIC_PROFILE_ALL -- Like SOUPER_DYNAMIC_PROFILE but
instruments each site that is potentially optimizable by Souper, as
opposed to sites that actually get optimized. Should be used in
combination with SOUPER_NO_INFER.

SOUPER_EXPLOIT_BLOCKPCS -- Optimize using blockpcs.

SOUPER_FIRST_OPT / SOUPER_LAST_OPT -- Assign a number to each
optimization found in the current compilation unit and only perform
those that fall within the range [SOUPER_FIRST_OPT
.. SOUPER_LAST_OPT], inclusive. Used for debugging Souper

SOUPER_IGNORE_SOLVER_ERRORS -- Keep going when the solver fails, for
example due to running out of memory or time.

SOUPER_INFER_INT -- Try to synthesize constants.

SOUPER_INFER_NOP -- Try to synthesize nops: Optimizations where the
output is equivalent to one of its inputs. For example, this
expression can be optimized to a nop: x = bswap(bswap(x))

SOUPER_NO_EXPLOIT_UB -- Do not exploit LLVM-level undefined behavior
when making inferences.

SOUPER_NO_EXTERNAL_CACHE -- Don't ask the running Redis instance for
cached inferences.

SOUPER_NO_HARVEST_KNOWN_BITS -- Don't query LLVM's bit-level dataflow
analyses when harvesting.

SOUPER_NO_INFER -- Don't run inference at all; used for populating the
cache.

SOUPER_NO_SOUPER -- Don't run Souper at all.

SOUPER_SAVE_BITCODE -- The value of this variable is the name of a
directory where a copy of the bitcode for the compiled file will be
stored.

SOUPER_SKIP_FILES -- Do not apply Souper (as if SOUPER_NO_SOUPER were
set) to any of the comma-separated list of files found in the value of
this variable.

SOUPER_SOLVER -- The SAT solver for Souper to use, e.g.
-z3-path=/usr/bin/z3.

SOUPER_STATIC_PROFILE -- During compilation, communicate with a running
Redis instance in order to record the number of times each optimization
was performed.

SOUPER_STATS -- Ask LLVM to print statistics.
