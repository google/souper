Souper is a superoptimizer for LLVM IR. It uses an SMT solver to help identify
missing peephole optimizations in LLVM's midend optimizers.

Requirements
------------

You will need a reasonably modern compiler toolchain. LLVM has instructions
on how to get one for Linux:
http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#getting-a-modern-host-c-toolchain

You will also need CMake to build Souper and its dependencies.

To run Souper over a bitcode file, you will need an SMT solver. Souper can
use Boolector, CVC4 or STP.

Building Souper
---------------

1. Download and build dependencies:
     $ ./update_deps.sh $buildtype
   $buildtype may be Debug or Release.

2. Run CMake from a build directory:
     $ mkdir /path/to/souper-build
     $ cd /path/to/souper-build
     $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=$buildtype /path/to/souper
   Be sure to select the same build type used when compiling the dependencies.

3. Run 'make' from the build directory.

Using Souper
------------

After following the above instructions, you will have a Souper
executable in /path/to/souper-build/souper and a Clang executable in
/path/to/souper/third_party/llvm/$buildtype/bin/clang.  You can use the
Clang executable to create an LLVM bitcode file like this:
    $ /path/to/clang -emit-llvm -c -o /path/to/file.bc /path/to/file.c

Once you have a bitcode file you can invoke Souper with the path to the
bitcode file as a command line argument. You will also need one of these
flags to tell Souper where the SMT solver executable is:

  -boolector-path=<path>       - Path to Boolector executable
  -cvc4-path=<path>            - Path to CVC4 executable
  -stp-path=<path>             - Path to STP executable

For example:
    $ /path/to/souper -stp-path=/path/to/stp-build/stp /path/to/file.bc

Souper will extract SMT queries from the bitcode file and list them together
with the result from the SMT solver. Any unsatisfiable queries (which represent
missed optimization opportunities) will have "unsat" printed after them,
while satisfiable queries will have "sat".
