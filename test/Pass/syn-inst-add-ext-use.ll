; Investigation and improvement are needed. Current instruction synthesis can
; not optimization instruction with outside uses smartly. This case shows this
; issue: %a, %b and %c all have external uses, and they should not be swiped
; out, thus synthesis a new instruction "add %x, 4" only for replacing %d is not
; necessary. Now souper does this redundant optimization.
; This issue is now provisionally fixed by considering the cost of instructions
; in the LHS with external uses to be 0.
